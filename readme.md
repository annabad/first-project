## I am studying in *Badmaeva Academy*.

It was created by __me__ specially for __me__.


I am using 3 platforms for education:
* Yandex Practicum
* Hexlet
* Stepik

I can't choose the best one, because each of them has its own **_advantages_**.

I am happy that I already got acquainted with the command line.
'''bash
ls -la

### This code is not an abracadabra for me anymore.
